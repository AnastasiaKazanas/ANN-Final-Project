# Combating Fake News with Machine Learning
## Introduction and Problem Statement
### Context and Background Information
In today’s digital world, social media spreads information quickly, but it has also fueled the rise of fake news. Designed to mislead, fake news undermines trust and distorts our understanding of important events. Our project uses machine learning to distinguish real news from fake, helping to promote reliable media consumption.
### Purpose and Objectives of the Project
Our goal is to create a machine learning model that accurately classifies news articles as real or fake, utilizing both Bag of Words and BERT embeddings for feature representation. By doing so, we aim to provide a tool that helps individuals verify information and make informed decisions. The key objectives of our project are:
  - Train a reliable model using both Bag of Words and BERT embeddings on diverse datasets, including a 2017 news article dataset and a Twitter dataset.
  - Evaluate the model’s accuracy and reliability across different contexts.
### Problem Questions
This project explores the following research questions:
  - How can machine learning effectively differentiate between real and fake news articles?
  - Which features of news content are most indicative of authenticity or falsehood?
  - How can fake news detection models be optimized to reduce misclassification and enhance public trust in automated tools?

By addressing these questions, we aim to develop a scalable, evidence-based solution to combat misinformation and empower individuals to make informed decisions using credible sources.

## Methodology and Data 
### Theoretical Framework
The project is grounded in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, utilizing neural networks like LSTM and Transformers to capture the contextual relationships in text data. These technologies are well-suited for processing the sequential nature of language and extracting meaningful patterns that are crucial for classification tasks.
### Project Design
The project involves several stages:
#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Utilizing datasets from sources like Kaggle, which include general news, Twitter feeds, and specific topics like COVID-19. Text normalization, tokenization, and removal of stopwords are key preprocessing steps.
#### Model Development
Starting with simpler classifiers for baseline measurements and progressing to more complex neural networks. Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings are used for feature extraction.
#### Model Validation
Using cross-validation and other techniques to ensure the model performs well across different datasets.
### Recsources and Data
We sourced our datasets from reputable platforms like Kaggle, encompassing various types of news contexts including general news, Twitter feeds, and COVID-19 related news. The data preprocessing phase involved normalizing text, removing noise, and employing techniques like tokenization and stopwords removal.
### Evaluation
To ensure the reliability of our models, we employed cross-validation techniques and rigorous testing across different datasets. This approach helped in fine-tuning our models and reducing overfitting, thereby improving their generalizability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Results
We achieved promising results, with our models demonstrating high accuracy rates in distinguishing between real and fake news. The models performed well across various contexts, including newer topics incorporated post-training.

## Discussion 
### Context of the Results
Our results show that the models are capable of learning and generalizing from the training data to effectively classify new, unseen data. This suggests that with continuous updates and training, such models can remain effective as the landscape of news evolves.
### Challenges Encountered
Challenges included data bias, which could lead to misclassifications, and computational limitations that affected the speed and scalability of our training processes. We addressed these by refining our models and incorporating feedback loops that allow the models to learn from their mistakes.
### Relation to Other Works
This project builds on existing work in NLP and fake news detection but pushes the boundaries by testing newer neural network architectures and adapting to rapidly changing news topics.
## Conclusion
The success of our project indicates that machine learning can be an effective tool against the spread of misinformation. By continuing to refine our models and expand their capabilities, we aim to create a reliable tool that can play a crucial role in the fight for truth in media.
